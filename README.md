This project is a proof-of-concept machine learning application based on real-world clinical data.
The data collection and cleaning were carried out collaboratively by Meriem and Amina, while the modeling phase was conducted jointly by Meriem and Amina, under the supervision of Dr. Azibi and Dr. Melzi.
The Streamlit application was implemented with the assistance of Abdeljalil, who contributed to the interface development and deployment.
This collaborative effort aims to demonstrate the potential of predictive modeling in anticipating cancer treatment response using structured, pre-treatment data.
